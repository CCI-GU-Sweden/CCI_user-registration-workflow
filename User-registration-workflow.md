# CCI User Registration Workflow

## Purpose
This document describes the procedure for registering new users at the **Centre for Cellular Imaging (CCI)**, University of Gothenburg.  
The registration ensures that users are properly documented for **administrative** and **scientific** purposes before gaining access to CCI resources and services.

---

## Overview

Access to the CCI involves **two complementary registration parts**:

### 1. Administrative Registration (CrossLab)
This ensures that:
- Each user and research group is linked to a valid billing account.  
- Users gain access to CCI booking calendars, service requests, and training schedules.  
- All usage is tracked and billed through the **CrossLab** management system.

### 2. Scientific / Project Registration (NMI Portal)
This allows CCI to:
- Capture the scientific scope and impact of projects carried out at the facility.  
- Report the scientific output of the facility to **funding agencies** supporting its operation.  
- Use project information and acknowledgements as part of CCI’s **key performance indicators (KPIs)**.

---

## Registration Sequence

### Step 1 – Initial Contact and Project Meeting
New users should contact **cci@gu.se** to schedule an introductory meeting with a CCI staff scientist.  
During this meeting, we discuss:
- The scientific goals and imaging needs.  
- Sample preparation strategies and technical feasibility.  
- The most suitable equipment or service model (training, assisted imaging, or full service).  
- The registration process and required documentation.

---

### Step 2 – Principal Investigator (PI) Registration in CrossLab
Each research group must have an active **PI account in CrossLab** before users can register.

- GU-affiliated PIs register using their University of Gothenburg (SWAMID) credentials.  
- External academic or company PIs register using their institutional email address.

PI registration includes:
- Creating a **Lab group** in CrossLab.  
- Providing billing details (*Ansvarsnummer* for GU or invoice information for external users).  
- Ensuring group members are correctly associated with the lab.

> Reference: *CrossLab manual – GU PI* or *CrossLab manual – External PI.*

---

### Step 3 – User Registration in CrossLab
Once the PI’s group is registered, individual users can register under that lab in CrossLab.  
During registration:
1. Users must read and **accept the CCI User Rules** (this is part of the registration process).  
2. After submitting the online form, users must:
   - Print the **“Registration Form for New Users.”**  
   - Sign the printed form.  
   - Obtain the PI’s signature.  
   - Deliver the signed form to CCI staff (physical copy preferred).

A user is **considered active** only after the signed registration form has been received by CCI staff.  
Once active, users can be scheduled for training and gain access to CCI resources.

> Reference: *CrossLab manual – GU User* or *CrossLab manual – External User.*

---

### Step 4 – Project Registration in the NMI Portal
All scientific projects performed at the CCI should be registered in the **National Microscopy Infrastructure (NMI) Portal**.  
This enables CCI to document the scientific use of its services and report impact to its **funding agencies**.  

Users must:
1. Visit [https://nmi.scilifelab.se](https://nmi.scilifelab.se).  
2. Create an account and submit a new project application.  
3. Select **“GU – Centre for Cellular Imaging”** as the host node.  
4. Provide a short, non-confidential project description (a few sentences per field).  

> Reference: *NMI Portal Instructions.*

---

### Step 5 – Service Activation and Training
Once the **signed registration form** is received, the user becomes officially active.  
CCI staff then:
- Organize training and/or service scheduling.  
- Grant access to booking calendars in CrossLab for trained systems.  
- Ensure that data management guidelines (e.g., OMERO usage) are followed.

---

## Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Principal Investigator (PI)** | Registers the group and billing information in CrossLab; approves new users under their lab; ensures group compliance with CCI policies. |
| **User** | Completes registration in CrossLab, accepts user rules, provides signed form to CCI staff, and registers project in the NMI Portal when applicable. |
| **CCI Staff Scientist** | Guides users through the process, verifies forms, activates access once documentation is complete, and oversees training and service initiation. |
| **CCI Administration** | Manages billing setup, verifies PI and user registrations, and handles invoicing for internal and external users. |

---

## Required Documents
- **CCI User Rules** (PDF or web version)  
- **CrossLab Manual** (relevant to user type)  
- **NMI Portal Instructions**  
- **Data Management Guidelines** (OMERO / NAS usage)

---

## Activation Criteria
A user is **considered active** at the CCI only after:
1. The **CrossLab registration form** has been signed by both the user and PI.  
2. The **signed form** has been received by CCI staff.  
3. The user has accepted the **CCI User Rules** in CrossLab.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is the difference between CrossLab and the NMI Portal?
- **CrossLab** handles the *administrative* side of your registration — it allows us to manage bookings, training, services, and billing.  
- The **NMI Portal** records the *scientific* projects performed at CCI. This information helps us report to our funding agencies and demonstrate the scientific impact of the facility.

---

### 2. Do I need to register in both systems?
Yes, but for different reasons:  
- **CrossLab registration** is *mandatory* for access to the facility, instrument booking, and training.  
- **NMI project registration** is *highly encouraged* for all scientific projects performed at CCI, as it supports our continued funding and national reporting.

---

### 3. Do I need to register a project in the NMI Portal to gain access to CCI services?
No.  
Once you are an active user in CrossLab, you can access CCI equipment and services according to your training and project needs.  
However, registering your project in the NMI Portal is **strongly recommended**.  
Without project registrations, CCI cannot demonstrate the scientific use of its infrastructure — which is essential to sustain the facility economically.  
For large or long-term projects requiring significant CCI staff involvement, we may request an NMI project registration **before** starting the work.

---

### 4. When am I considered an active user at CCI?
You become an active user once:  
1. You have completed your CrossLab registration and accepted the user rules.  
2. The signed registration form (user + PI signatures) has been received by CCI staff.  

Only then can you schedule training or request services.

---

### 5. My PI is not listed in CrossLab — what should I do?
Your PI must first create a **lab group** in CrossLab following the *PI registration manual* (GU or External).  
Once the group exists, you can register under it as a user.

---

### 6. How long does activation take?
Typically within **1–2 business days** after the signed form is received by CCI staff.  
You will then be able to schedule training and access booking calendars for approved systems.

---

### 7. What are the CCI User Rules, and why do I need to accept them?
The CCI User Rules ensure safe, responsible, and fair use of shared equipment.  
They include laboratory conduct, booking and cancellation policies, and data-handling procedures.  
All users must read and accept them during the CrossLab registration process.

---

### 8. How do I transfer and manage my data?
CCI uses **OMERO** as the primary system for data transfer and image data management.  
OMERO ensures secure, structured, and shareable access to microscopy data.  
In some specific cases (e.g., large temporary data sets or compatibility issues), a **NAS server** may be used instead.  
CCI staff will inform you which method applies to your project.

---

### 9. What billing information is required for external users or companies?
For new company users, we need the following details to create a billing profile:
- Full billing address  
- Organization number  
- VAT registration number  
- Instructions for e-invoicing or, if unavailable, an email address for receiving PDF invoices  

---

### 10. Who should I contact if I have trouble registering or logging in?
If you encounter any issues:
- For **CrossLab access or user registration**, contact **cci@gu.se**.  
- For **technical issues with CrossLab**, use the *Support Portal* link inside CrossLab to submit a ticket.  
- For **NMI Portal problems**, contact **support@nmisweden.se**.

---

### 11. I have used microscopes before. Can I access the equipment without training?
No.  
All users must complete the **equipment-specific training** provided by CCI staff before receiving access, regardless of prior experience.  
Training ensures that every user is familiar with the specific setup, software configuration, and facility policies that may differ from other institutions.  
However, the training can be **adapted to your experience level** — for example, sessions may be shortened if you demonstrate sufficient proficiency during the practical part of the training.
